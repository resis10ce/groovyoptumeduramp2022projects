Groovy is a well established player in the JVM 
since a few years ago. Its increased popularity 
across the years has spawned several projects 
that conform the Groovy Ecosystem. 
You've probably heard of Grails, Gradle, 
Griffon and Spock. But what about the rest of 
projects that are just waiting around the corner 
to be discovered and make your life easier? 
This talk presents them tools and libraries that 
use Groovy as the main driving force to get the job done.
